Fiji plugin for my image analysis

These files are written to analyze the tif images generated by our Shutter 2-photon microscope using scanimage software.
Some of them need to import Bob's original code, and make to apply to deep folder layers, and multiple folders.
However, to import python coded plugins, you may need to use old stale version of Fiji-win64-20130715
